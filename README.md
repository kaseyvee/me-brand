# me.brand() (wip)

A template generator for providing users a medium to introduce themselves with an eye-catching photo/banner using recognizable and iconic designs.

## Screenshots

Users can choose from a specific template.

Users can customize text, font size, position with drag and drop, and toggle between a banner and square layout. More options are available depending on which template is chosen.

## To-Do
- **chocky** download is buggy- if you want to use this banner, zoom in to your desired size and screenshot
- **soobway** does not have icons and lil blurb implemented yet
- bug when downloading while viewing on another monitor- image size is smaller
